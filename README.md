### Our Goal
<p>Home Explained is a project orientated towards teaching users about our world.
It includes <b> English, math, science, geography, and history.</b> The project allows users to learn these topics via fun interactive games.
Users are allowed to learn not only through interactive games but also through articles, videos, and books.


Home Explained is directed towards classrooms, homeschooling, or extracurricular activities! The project is free for those doing homeschooling and put at a cheap price for schools.</p>

## Current Team

<p> Currently it's only developed by me, Grumbo!
This also makes the progress very slow because I have to do everything myself!
If you like the project, please leave me some feedback in my <b>email or discord</b>!<p>

## Set-up Process ðŸš€

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
